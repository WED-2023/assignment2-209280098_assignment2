# Space Game - by Lidor Mashiach 🚀

## Overview 🌌
"Space Game" is a browser-based space shooter game developed as part of the third-year project in Software and Information Systems Engineering. The goal of this project was to combine both front-end and back-end development techniques to create an engaging, interactive game. 🎮✨

## Features 🌟
- **User Registration and Login**: Allows users to register, log in, and customize their gaming experience. 🔑
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Users can select the color of their spaceship, set game time, and even choose a key to fire. 🚀🔥
- **Leaderboard**: Displays top player scores based on game performance. 🏆
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience across devices, including desktop and mobile (Note: For mobile, the user needs to connect a keyboard to interact with the game effectively). 📱💻
- **Validation**: All form fields are thoroughly validated, including checking the user's age to ensure they are at least 8 years old. This measure helps prevent younger users from excessive screen time and gaming addiction. 🛡️
- **LocalStorage**: Player preferences, such as selected spaceship color, fire key, and game timer settings, are saved using `localStorage`, ensuring a personalized experience across sessions. 🔒

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the game and all pages. 📄
- **CSS**: Used for styling the pages, ensuring they are visually appealing and responsive. 🎨
- **JavaScript**: Implemented for the dynamic behavior of the site and game logic, including the leaderboard, form handling, and game mechanics. 💻
- **Fetch API**: Used for preloading pages behind the scenes to optimize performance and allow smooth transitions between different sections of the game. 🔄
- **LocalStorage**: Used for saving the user's game settings and leaderboard data to persist across sessions. 🧠
- **No additional plugins** were used outside of the core web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Fetch API, LocalStorage). 🚫

## Game Screens 🎮
1. **Welcome Screen**: The main screen where the user can log in or register. 🌟
2. **Configuration Screen**: Where the user can adjust the game settings, including time, spaceship color, and fire key. 🛠️
3. **Game Screen**: The main screen where the user plays the game, moving their spaceship and shooting enemies. 🚀
4. **Leaderboard**: Displays the top players and their scores. 🏅
5. **Contact**: Allows the user to get in touch via a contact form. ✉️

## How to Play 🕹️
1. **Register/Log in**: Start by creating an account or logging in if you already have one. 📝
2. **Configuration**: Once logged in, set your spaceship's color, select your fire key, and set your game time. 🎮
3. **Play**: Start the game and defeat enemies to accumulate points. Try to get to the top of the leaderboard! 🚀
4. **Leaderboard**: Keep track of your progress and see how you rank among other players. 🏆

## Key Features and Technical Implementation 🔧
- **Preloading Pages**: We used the `fetch()` API to preload all necessary pages (like login, register, about, etc.) behind the scenes to optimize page load times and ensure smooth transitions between screens. 🌐
- **Dynamic Settings**: Users can customize their game experience, including selecting the color of their spaceship 🚀 and defining the key they wish to use for firing 🔥.
- **Validation**: We implemented a series of validation checks to ensure that users fill out their information correctly, such as validating the user's age (minimum 8 years old), checking that passwords meet security requirements, and ensuring that email and username aren't already taken. 🛡️
- **User Data**: All user configurations (including selected color, game time, and fire key) are saved using `localStorage` so that settings persist across sessions. 🔒
